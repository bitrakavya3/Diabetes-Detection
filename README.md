# Diabetes-Detection
Diabetes is a rapidly growing global health concern, with significant implications for      
individual well-being and healthcare systems. Early detection and timely intervention are 
critical to managing the disease and reducing the risk of complications such as heart disease, 
kidney failure, and vision loss. In this project, we develop a machine learning (ML) 
classification model to detect diabetes based on key diagnostic health parameters, using the 
well-known Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning 
Repository. 
The project workflow follows a structured data science pipeline. It begins with data 
preprocessing, including handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and balancing 
class distributions using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling 
Technique). Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the relationships 
between variables, identify outliers, and visualize data distributions. 
Multiple classification algorithms are implemented and compared, including Logistic 
Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting. Feature selection is carried out using methods such 
as correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination to enhance model efficiency and 
accuracy. The models are evaluated using robust metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, 
F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using 
Grid Search and Cross-Validation to optimize model performance and reduce overfitting. 
All analysis is conducted using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, 
Seaborn, and Matplotlib for modeling and visualization. The final model demonstrates strong 
predictive performance and can serve as a reliable decision-support tool for healthcare 
providers. 
This project highlights the power of machine learning and big data analytics in healthcare, 
showcasing how predictive models can assist in early disease detection, risk stratification, and 
proactive patient care. Future work may include integrating real-time health data from 
wearable devices and expanding the model to include deep learning approaches for improved 
accuracy.
